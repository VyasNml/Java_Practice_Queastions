 * Question - 10
Create a Student class with the following attributes:
name (String)
rollNumber (int)
marks (float)

The class should include:

1. A constructor to initialize all the fields.
2. A method to display student details.
3. Overload a method called updateMarks to update marks in two ways:
- By providing the new marks as a float value.
- By providing the percentage increase in marks (as a float).

Also, create a main method to:
1. Input details of a student.
2. Update marks using both methods.
3. Display the updated details.

Example Input and Output:

Enter student details:
Name: John
Roll Number: 101

Updated Details: Name: John, Roll Number: 101, Marks: 90.5
