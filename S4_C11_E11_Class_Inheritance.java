 * Question - 11
Create a Java program to demonstrate the use of inheritance, method overriding, and interfaces using the following requirements:

1. Create an abstract class Shape with:
- An abstract method double calculateArea()
- A concrete method void displayShape() that prints ""This is a shape.""

2.Create two classes, Circle and Rectangle, that extend the Shape class:
- Circle should have a constructor that takes the radius as a parameter and override calculateArea() to return the area of the circle.
- Rectangle should have a constructor that takes length and breadth as parameters and override calculateArea() to return the area of the rectangle.
3. Implement an interface Drawable with a method void draw(). Both Circle and Rectangle should implement this interface and override draw() to display a message indicating which shape is being drawn.
4. In the main method:
- Create objects of Circle and Rectangle.
- Call the calculateArea(), draw(), and displayShape() methods on these objects.

Example Output:

This is a shape.
Drawing a Circle.
Area of Circle: 78.5

This is a shape.
Drawing a Rectangle.
Area of Rectangle: 50.0
