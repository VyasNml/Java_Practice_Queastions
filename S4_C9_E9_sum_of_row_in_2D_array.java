Write a Java program to find the row with the maximum sum in a 2D array.

Input the number of rows and columns in the array.
Take user input to populate the 2D array.
Use a for-each loop to iterate over the array and calculate the sum of each row.
Print the row number (1-based indexing) and the corresponding sum of the row with the maximum sum.

Input:
3 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12

Output:
Row with the maximum sum: 3
